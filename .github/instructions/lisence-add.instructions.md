# Instructions for License Addition
MSCCL++ is licensed under the MIT License. All source files should include the license header at the top.

## License Header
For python source files, add the following license header at the top of each file:
```python
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
# Licensed under the MIT License.
```
For C++ source files, add the following license header at the top of each file:
```cpp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT License.
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Open each source file in the `mscclpp` repo.
2. Check if the license header is already present. Also ensure that the license text is correct and up-to-date.
   - For Python files, it should be the Python license header.
   - For C++ files, it should be the C++ license header.
   - If the license header is missing or incorrect, proceed to the next step.
3. If not, add the appropriate license header at the very top of the file.
