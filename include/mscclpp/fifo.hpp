/* This is a concurrent fifo where multiple device threads can push mscclppTrigger work elements to
 * and a single host proxy thread consumes these work elements. There is a head pointer allocated on device
 * which starts with 0 and goes to 2^64-1 which is almost infinity. There are two copies of tail, one
 * that is on the deivce (tailReplica) and another that is on host (proxyState->fifoTailHost).
 * The host always has the "true" tail and occasionally, pushes it to the copy on the device.
 * Therefore, most of the time, the device has a stale version. The invariants are:
 * tailReplica <= proxyState->fifoTailHost <= head.
 * push() function increments head, proxyState->fifoTailHost is updated in proxy.cc:mscclppProxyService
 * and it occasionally flushes it to tailReplica via a cudaMemcpyAsync.
 *
 * Why duplicating the tail is a good idea? The fifo is large engouh and we do not need frequent updates
 * for the tail as there is usually enough space for device threads to push their work into.
