Welcome to MSCCL++'s documentation!
===================================

MSCCL++ is a GPU-driven communication stack for scalable AI applications. It is designed to provide a high-performance, scalable, and customizable communication stack for distributed GPU applications.

Getting Started
---------------
- Follow the :doc:`quick start <getting-started/quickstart>` for your platform of choice.
- Take a look at the :doc:`tutorials <getting-started/tutorials/index>` to learn how to write your first mscclpp program.
