A GPU-driven communication stack for scalable AI applications.

See [Quick Start](docs/quickstart.md) to quickly get started.

## Overview

MSCCL++ redefines the interface for inter-GPU communication, thereby delivering a highly efficient and customizable communication stack tailored for distributed GPU applications. The followings describe the key features of MSCCL++.

* **On-GPU Interfaces.** MSCCL++ provides communication interfaces to be called by a **GPU thread**. Users can easily implement highly optimized communication logics inside a GPU kernel, without awareness of detailed communication mechanisms. This enables users to implement highly fine-grained system pipelining (i.e., hiding communication delays by overlapping with computation), which has been difficult for CPU-based interfaces.

* **Fine-grained Abstracts.** MSCCL++ provides fine-grained abstracts for communication primitives, such as `put()`, `get()`, `signal()`, `flush()`, and `wait()`. This enables users to easily implement flexible communication logics, such as overlapping communication with computation, or implementing customized collective communication algorithms.

* **Converged Interfaces.** MSCCL++ provides consistent interfaces regardless of the location of the remote GPU (either on the local node or on a remote node) or the underlying link (either NVLink/xGMI or InfiniBand). This simplifies the code for inter-GPU communication, which is often complex and error-prone.

## Feature Examples

The following illustrates key features of MSCCL++.

### On-GPU Communication Interfaces

MSCCL++ provides inter-GPU communication interfaces to be called by a GPU thread. For example, the `put()` method in the following example copies 1KB data from the local GPU to a remote GPU. `channel` is a peer-to-peer communication channel between two GPUs, which consists of information on send/receive buffers. `channel` is initialized from the host side before the kernel execution.

```cpp
__device__ mscclpp::DeviceHandle<mscclpp::SimpleProxyChannel> channel;
__global__ void gpuKernel() {
  ...
  // Only one thread is needed for this method.
  channel.put(/*dstOffset=*/ 0, /*srcOffset=*/ 0, /*size=*/ 1024);
  ...
}
```

MSCCL++ also provides efficient synchronization methods, `signal()`, `flush()`, and `wait()`. For example, we can implement a simple barrier between two ranks (peer-to-peer connected through `channel`) as follows. Explanation of each method is inlined.

```cpp
// Only one thread is needed for this function.
__device__ void barrier() {
  // Inform the peer GPU that I have arrived at this point.
  channel.signal();
  // Flush the previous signal() call, which will wait for completion of signaling.
  channel.flush();
  // Wait for the peer GPU to call signal().
  channel.wait();
  // Now this thread is synchronized with the remote GPUâ€™s thread.
  // Users may call a local synchronize functions (e.g., __syncthreads())
  // to synchronize other local threads as well with the remote side.
}
```

MSCCL++ provides consistent interfaces, i.e., the above interfaces are used regardless of the location of the remote GPU (either on the local node or on a remote node) or the underlying link (either NVLink or InfiniBand).

### Host-Side Communication Proxy

MSCCL++ interfaces may send a request (called triggers) to a GPU-external helper that conducts key functionalities such as DMA or RDMA. This helper is called a *proxy*. MSCCL++ provides a default implementation of a proxy, which is a background host thread that busy polls triggers from GPUs and conducts functionalities accordingly. For example, the following is a typical host-side code for MSCCL++.

```cpp
// Bootstrap: initialize control-plane connections between all ranks
auto bootstrap = std::make_shared<mscclpp::TcpBootstrap>(rank, world_size);
// Create a communicator for connection setup
mscclpp::Communicator comm(bootstrap);
// Setup connections here using `comm`
...
// Construct the default proxy
mscclpp::ProxyService proxyService();
// Start the proxy
proxyService.startProxy();
// Run the user application, i.e., launch GPU kernels here
...
// Stop the proxy after the application is finished
proxyService.stopProxy();
```

While the default implementation already enables any kinds of communication, MSCCL++ also supports users to easily implement their own customized proxies for further optimization. For example, the following example re-defines how to interpret triggers from GPUs.

```cpp
// Proxy FIFO is obtained from mscclpp::Proxy on the host and copied to the device.
__device__ mscclpp::FifoDeviceHandle fifo;
__global__ void gpuKernel() {
  ...
  // Only one thread is needed for the followings
  mscclpp::ProxyTrigger trigger;
  // Send a custom request: "1"
  trigger.fst = 1;
  fifo.push(trigger);
  // Send a custom request: "2"
  trigger.fst = 2;
  fifo.push(trigger);
  // Send a custom request: "0xdeadbeef"
  trigger.fst = 0xdeadbeef;
  fifo.push(trigger);
  ...
}

// Host-side custom proxy service
class CustomProxyService {
private:
  mscclpp::Proxy proxy_;
public:
  CustomProxyService() : proxy_([&](mscclpp::ProxyTrigger trigger) {
                                  // Custom trigger handler
                                  if (trigger.fst == 1) {
                                    // Handle request "1"
                                  } else if (trigger.fst == 2) {
                                    // Handle request "2"
                                  } else if (trigger.fst == 0xdeadbeef) {
                                    // Handle request "0xdeadbeef"
                                  }
                                },
                                [&]() { /* Empty proxy initializer */ }) {}
  void startProxy() { proxy_.start(); }
  void stopProxy()  { proxy_.stop(); }
};
```

Customized proxies can be used for conducting a series of pre-defined data transfers within only a single trigger from GPU at runtime. This would be more efficient than sending a trigger for each data transfer one by one.

### Python Interfaces

MSCCL++ provides Python bindings and interfaces, which simplifies integration with Python applications.
