class LoopIterationContext:
    """A context manager for defining pipelined loop operations in MSCCL++ programs.

    LoopIterationContext provides a way to define operations that will be executed
    in a pipelined manner across multiple iterations, where each pipeline iteration
    processes a specific chunk size (unit) of data. The pipeline allows overlapping
    execution of operations enabling efficient data processing.

    Attributes:
        unit (int): The unit size for pipeline operations.
        num_chunks (int): The number of chunks to process in the pipeline.
        operations (list): List of operations to be pipelined.

            unit (int): The unit size for pipeline operations, typically representing
                the granularity of data processing.
            num_chunks (int): The number of chunks to process in the pipeline,
                determining the pipeline depth.

        Example:
